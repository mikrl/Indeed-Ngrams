Released under v3 of the GGPL

This project is a web scraper for indeed.ca that enumerates all
possible ngrams over a search and returns the top 20 monograms to quadgrams.

The motivation comes from the difficulty in getting interviews from sending out resumes,
as well as the lack of feedback from companies to unsuccessful applicants.

I hope this project is used in both of these manners:

1. Candidates will find the right words to express their skills and get interviews
2. Candidates will be able to find the most in demand skills and learn them

This project is written in Python3 and uses the BeautifulSoup and nltk libraries.
Since I am using Arch Linux and my global python install may be different to yours,
I have attached a file requirements.txt to show you what you need.
